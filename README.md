# IgBlastN Sequence Classification Project

This project aims to classify FASTA sequences into either human or mouse categories using IgBlastN. This project consists of two main Python scripts (one for running IgBlastN on human and mouse identities and extracting percent identities per sequence, and another to split the fasta file into 2 seperate fasta files based on their classification) and an Excel file aggregating the results of the first Python scripts and determining the identity of each sequence. 

## Requirements
- Python 3
- [Igblast](https://github.com/xinyu-dev/igblast/blob/master/Using%20IgBlast.ipynb) and corresponding databases 
- Terminal
